# Service Desk tools

This is a tool that I created for myself for combining multiple systems that were used throughout a usual day on the service desk. This ranged from assisting with looking up colleague information, to performing account unlocks and resets for various internal systems. While not all information can be uploaded due to security, this project involved a good mix of combining online tools without APIs, internal powershell commands, and other applications all in one easily usable location. This was also my first major introduction to designing a locally accessed GUI to interact with.

The information in the code for this has been modified or redacted, including values and variable names, in order to protect company information and for security.


## Documentation
Before running application, all dependencies must be done. This can be done by running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After this is done, it would be ran by running the main.py file.
